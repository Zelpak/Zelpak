# Hey, I'm Zelpak 👋

I'm just a guy who loves building cool stuff. Whether it's a desktop app or a clean web project, I enjoy turning ideas into real things.

## 🛠 What I Do

- I make apps using **Python**
- I build websites with **Next.js**
- I’ve picked up **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and a bit of **Lua** along the way

## 🧪 Stuff I’ve Made

- **Synote** – my custom notepad app. Lightweight, clean, and built for people who just want to write without distractions.
- **Tipster** - my custom tip calculator app, lightweight, clean, & built for Casual Users, Professionals, Developers & Students & its totally easy to use!
- **Honey list** - a simple yet powerful lightweight to do application for users that need tasks done without forgetting! data is saved using JSON!

## 🚧 Always Learning

Right now I’m:
- Leveling up my Next.js skills
- Playing around with better layouts and UI
- Working on small tools that actually help people
